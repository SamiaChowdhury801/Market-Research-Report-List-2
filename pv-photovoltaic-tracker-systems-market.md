<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV (Photovoltaic) Tracker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis Trackers</li><li>Dual Axis Trackers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photovoltaic (PV) tracker systems enhance solar energy capture by adjusting the solar panels' orientation. Single-axis trackers rotate on one axis, following the sun's daily path, which increases energy production by 20-30% compared to fixed systems. Dual-axis trackers, on the other hand, adjust on two axes, optimizing solar capture throughout the year, including seasonal changes. While dual-axis trackers maximize efficiency, they are often more expensive and complex than single-axis systems, which are widely used in large-scale solar installations.</p></p>
