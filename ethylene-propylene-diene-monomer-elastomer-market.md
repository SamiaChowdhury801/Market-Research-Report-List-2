<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer Elastomer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Polymerization</li><li>Suspension Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) elastomer is produced through two primary market types: solution polymerization and suspension polymerization. Solution polymerization involves dissolving the monomers in a solvent, allowing precise control over the molecular weight and properties of the elastomer, resulting in higher flexibility and improved performance. Conversely, suspension polymerization disperses the monomers in a water-based medium, leading to higher production rates and cost efficiency. Both methods contribute to EPDM's versatile applications in automotive, construction, and consumer goods industries.</p></p>
